# Game of Life

A Godot implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life),
using a compute shader to calculate the steps of the game.

A single image is used to represent the game board,
which is then repeated to create the illusion of an infinite board.
